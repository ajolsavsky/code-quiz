## Description

This is a code quiz app, developed with JavaScript. Here is a [link to the deployed page](https://ajolsavsky.github.io/code-quiz/).

Some things that I learned while creating this project:

- The logic for this is complex, but I was able to tackle this one component at a time.
- This was my first time utilizing local storage and JSON, but am glad that the functionality is now working!

## User Story

```
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
```


## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score
```
